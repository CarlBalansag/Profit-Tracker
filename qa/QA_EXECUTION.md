# QA checkpoint and execution record

Checkpoint prepared September 11, 2026 (America/Los_Angeles), before the next QA fixes.
This is a recovery baseline, not a declaration that all application behavior is correct.

## Baseline checks

- API: 14 test files, 37 tests passed.
- Frontend: 6 test files, 15 tests passed, including the existing local expense insights changes.
- Prisma schema validation passed; no migrations or live database writes performed.
- Frontend production/PWA build passed; large bundle warning remains.
- Frontend lint failed. Its findings are pending QA-25 work.
- Documentation local links and tracked archive preservation were checked during the documentation cleanup.
- Browser workflows, real PostgreSQL concurrency, Discord OAuth and Cloudinary transfers were not revalidated at this checkpoint.
- probe-results.json is retained as an existing historical artifact; assertions in the old bug-reproduction runner can become obsolete after fixes. It is not the baseline pass/fail authority.

## Sequential work

Each task requires focused regression checks and an affected-flow QA pass before starting the next.
Commit each completed task separately and record precise coverage and remaining limitations here.

| Order | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | QA-22: intentional clearing of optional account fields | Pending |
| 2 | QA-21: Vendor/Marketplace editing | Pending |
| 3 | QA-06: consistent financial calculations | Pending |
| 4 | QA-19: Buyer/Invoice ownership | Pending |
| 5 | QA-20: inactive controls and unfinished workflows | Pending |
| 6 | QA-15: staged currency precision migration | Pending |
| 7 | QA-25: quality gates, coverage and finding reconciliation | Pending |
| 8 | Overall regression across all changes and all 25 findings | Pending |

A finding that has partial safeguards is not closed until its affected paths and relevant scenarios have been checked.
Existing user changes in Expenses and project documentation are part of this checkpoint; editor files and npm caches are excluded.
No deployment is authorized. A Git push must not trigger production or preview hosting.
